Lab 1 Worksheet Answers

1. Largest would be 2047, Smallest (most negative) would be -2048

2.
(i) integer, numberOfPages
The number of pages in a book will always be a whole, positive number

(ii) Long, numberOfAtoms
Avogadro's number is 6.022*10^23 and based off the thickness/other properties of a book, it’ll have any factor of that.
Also, number of atoms is a whole number AKA positive integer (you can’t have a fraction of an atom). Using a long allows us to have an accurate power and also keep using whole numbers.

(iii) Float, lenTriangleSide
If you wanted to be more accurate, you could use a double. But since we’re using inches, I felt that 7 significant digits was enough

(iv) String, myName

(v) Boolean, isNucleusDecayed 

(vi) Float, probabilityOfDecay
Like with the triangle, you could use a double if you really wanted that accuracy.

3. Start to do a little java programming! 
	Follow the example of the Hello.java program and do some testing of Java int and float.
	Write a short class called “Arithmetic” that in its main method does the following:

		Creates 4 local variables
			Two ints (call them a and b)
			Two floats (call them x and y)
		Performs the following arithmetic operations on every combination of two of these 
		and output using System.out.println each of the results
			Addition
			Division (in both directions)
